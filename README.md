This is a library for the hdc2010 temperature and humidity sensor.

It works for the STM32L4XX Microcontrollers. If you want to this to work with a different Microcontroller you need to change the included HAL Library from ST.

Example
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> #include "stm32l4xx_hal.h" // STM32L4 Series
-> #include "stm32f1xx_hal.h" // STM32F1 Series
